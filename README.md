# Titanic visualization
A visualization of the titanic tragedy using d3.js -- [View] (click open in a new window to view the whole chart)

## Summary
This visualization tries to explain what factors played the most vital part of determining who survived and who perished in the titanic trajedy. These factors are mostly *Sex* and *Passenger Class*.

## Design
The chart type used is the [marimekko chart], I chose it because it efficiently shows the differences in distribution between different groups or categories (in this case males/females and survived/perished). 

One of the main design choices is to enable the user to select different passenger classes using buttons which will cause the chart to animate and show the corresponding distribution.

After collecting feedback, there wasn't any big changes to the visualization, just some change of styles and a couple of illustrations to make the chart more understandable.

## Feedback
####Feedback after the initial chart by **yelghareeb**:
> I think that the chart is quite impressive and it is easily understandable within a few seconds. However there are a couple of comments that I would like to add:

> * The class buttons are better to be made more clear by enlarging them.
> * It would be better to tell the user in which class they are into right now (by coloring the current class or adding an additional label).

####Feedback after the initial chart by **aerrayes**:
> The chart is clear as to what it presents.
But, in my opinion "None" should be changed to "All" to better clarify all classes.
Also, in the chart it was not clear at first which part represented males and which represented females.

####Feedback after the initial chart by **mohamed-gazala**:
> chart is simple and understandable . however i prefer the percentage of the gender to be written below the horizontal axis other than the top of the chart.
